Genomes are subject to damage by chemical and physical agents in the environment (e.g. UV and ionizing radiations, chemical mutagens, fungal and bacterial toxins, etc.) and by free radicals or alkylating agents endogenously generated in metabolism. DNA is also damaged because of errors during its replication. A variety of different DNA repair pathways have been reported that include direct reversal, base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, photoreactivation, bypass, double-strand break repair pathway, and mismatch repair pathway [goid 6281] [evidence IEA]; Mutations occurring somatically that result in amino acid changes in the rearranged V regions of immunoglobulins [goid 16446] [evidence IEA]; The switching of activated B cells from IgM biosynthesis to biosynthesis of other isotypes of immunoglobulin, accomplished through a recombination process involving an intrachromosomal deletion involving switch regions that reside 5' of each constant region gene segment in the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus [goid 45190] [evidence IEA]","Interacting selectively with DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) [goid 3677] [pmid 11842105] [evidence IDA]; Catalysis of the hydrolysis of ester linkages within nucleic acids by creating internal breaks [goid 4519] [evidence IEA]; Catalysis of the endonucleolytic cleavage of RNA in RNA-DNA hybrids to 5'-phosphomonoesters [goid 4523] [pmid 10364235] [evidence TAS]; Interacting selectively with any protein or protein complex (a complex of two or more proteins that may include other nonprotein molecules) [goid 5515] [pmid 14676842] [evidence IPI]; Interacting selectively with any protein or protein complex (a complex of two or more proteins that may include other nonprotein molecules) [goid 5515] [pmid 11429708] [evidence IPI]; Interacting selectively with any protein or protein complex (a complex of two or more proteins that may include other nonprotein molecules) [goid 5515] [pmid 12414623] [evidence IPI]; Interacting selectively with any protein or protein complex (a complex of two or more proteins that may include other nonprotein molecules) [goid 5515] [pmid 14676842] [evidence IPI]; Interacting selectively with any protein or protein complex (a complex of two or more proteins that may include other nonprotein molecules) [goid 5515] [pmid 15225546] [evidence IPI]; Interacting selectively with any protein or protein complex (a complex of two or more proteins that may include other nonprotein molecules) [goid 5515] [pmid 15886194] [evidence IPI]; Interacting selectively with any protein or protein complex (a complex of two or more proteins that may include other nonprotein molecules) [goid 5515] [pmid 9788596] [evidence IPI]; Interacting selectively with any protein or protein complex (a complex of two or more proteins that may include other nonprotein molecules) [goid 5515] [pmid 10856833] [evidence IPI]; Interacting selectively with any protein or protein complex (a complex of two or more proteins that may include other nonprotein molecules) [goid 5515] [pmid 11427529] [evidence IPI]; Interacting selectively with any protein or protein complex (a complex of two or more proteins that may include other nonprotein molecules) [goid 5515] [pmid 11429708] [evidence IPI]; Interacting selectively with any protein or protein complex (a complex of two or more proteins that may include other nonprotein molecules) [goid 5515] [pmid 2414623] [evidence IPI]; Catalysis of the hydrolysis of various bonds, e.g. C-O, C-N, C-C, phosphoric anhydride bonds, etc. Hydrolase is the systematic name for any enzyme of EC class 3 [goid 16787] [evidence IEA]; Catalysis of the sequential cleavage of mononucleotides from a free 5' terminus of a single-stranded DNA molecule [goid 45145] [pmid 10608837] [evidence IDA]; Catalysis of the cleavage of a flap structure in DNA, but not other DNA structures; processes the ends of Okazaki fragments in lagging strand DNA synthesis [goid 48256] [pmid 11842105] [evidence IDA]; Catalysis of the cleavage of a flap structure in DNA, but not other DNA structures; processes the ends of Okazaki fragments in lagging strand DNA synthesis [goid 48256] [pmid 10608837] [evidence IDA]; Catalysis of the sequential cleavage of mononucleotides from a free 5' terminus of a double-stranded DNA molecule [goid 51908] [pmid 11842105] [evidence IDA]; Catalysis of the sequential cleavage of mononucleotides from a free 5' terminus of a double-stranded DNA molecule [goid 51908] [pmid 10608837] [evidence IDA]; Catalysis of the hydrolysis of ester linkages within nucleic acids by removing nucleotide residues from the 3' or 5' end [goid 4527] [evidence IEA]; Interacting selectively with DNA of a specific structure or configuration e.g. triplex DNA binding or bent DNA binding [goid 43566] [evidence IEA]; Catalysis of the hydrolysis of ester linkages within nucleic acids by removing nucleotide residues from the 3' or 5' end [goid 4527] [evidence IEA]; Interacting selectively with DNA of a specific structure or configuration e.g. triplex DNA binding or bent DNA binding [goid 43566] [evidence IEA]","HEX1; hExoI","HEX1; hExoI","NM_006027.3","ILMN_1673721","EXO1","exonuclease 1",1.89351872222222,7.98210697222222,11.0061565942659,5.71824278740484e-05,0.0473930751606839,2.52908174241749
